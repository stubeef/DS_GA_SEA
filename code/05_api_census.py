CLASS: Getting Data from APIs

Exercise 1 - retrieving US Census language use data

'''
# Link to the Census Bureau language stats API description page

# Look through the API description links and examples to see what use you have avaialble

# Use the requests library to interact with a URL

import requests
# Use a URL example in a browser to see the result returned and the use request to access with python
# http://api.census.gov/data/2013/language?get=EST,LANLABEL,NAME&for=state:06&LAN=625
r = requests.get('http://api.census.gov/data/2013/language?get=EST,LANLABEL,NAME&for=state:06&LAN=625')

# modify the request to get languges 625 through 650 so we can see a larger sample of what is returned from the request
# Hint the syntax for more than one language number is similar to one we use for multiple elements in a list


# check the status: 200 means success, 4xx means error


# view the raw response text


# Convert to json()


# 
#look at the contents of the output of the json() method.  Most JASON returned is a dict but it looks like this one is a list of lists

# Convert the json() method output into a dataframe with the first list as the column header and the rest as rows of data


# Sort the dataframe decending by the number of people speaking the language
# Check the data type of 'EST', the number of people that speak the language


# Now create a new request that brings in the stats for all the US and primary languages
# See the websites links for syntax for US and range of language nunbers



### Bonus
# Create a loop that will collect the counts of Spanish language speakers by state
