## General Assembly Data Science Course: Example Student Projects

This repository is a collection of **example projects** from students in General Assembly's part-time [Data Science course](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science). Its purpose is to give incoming students a sense of the variety and scope of past projects, and to spur their thinking for their own projects.
